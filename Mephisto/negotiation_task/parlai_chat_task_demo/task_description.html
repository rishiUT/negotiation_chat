  <h3>Motivation</h3>
  <p>The goal of this task is to negotiate the price of an item listed on Craigslist with the aim to maximize your own gain while also reaching an agreement with the other side. </p>
  <br />
  <p class="tab">For this purpose, you will be paired up with another crowd worker and will be assigned the role of a buyer or a seller. Your co-worker will be assigned the role complementary to yours (For example: If you are assigned the role of a buyer, your co-worker will be assigned the role of a seller and vice versa). The buyers will receive a bonus payment if they get the seller to agree for sale of an item at a given target price that is lower than the listing price. On the other hand, the sellers will receive a bonus payment if they get the buyer to pay for their item an amount as close as possible to the listing price.
